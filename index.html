                    <p class="bio">When it comes to achieving a lot in so little time, Cream is nearly unmatched. Today known by the mainstream as one of Clapton's most famous efforts within a band, Cream began its short life in 1966 when Eric Clapton, then of The Yardbirds and John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers decided to form a personal band with drummer Ginger Baker, then of The Graham Bond Organisation. The two hit it off straight away, admiring each other's musical expertise and taste. However, Clapton insisted on bringing bassist Jack Bruce to the fold as Baker was driving him home from a gig back to London, and Baker was said to have almost crashed the car from shock of Clapton's suggestion.

                        Having played with The Graham Bond organisation previously, Baker and Bruce had at that time a long history of antagonism, where they sabotaged each other's instrument and Baker having at one point threatened Bruce at knife-point to leave the band.
                        
                        Despite this, the world's first supergroup was formed. Three and a half albums later (as their last, titled "Goodbye" from '68 consisted of three live recordings and three new songs) in which the supergroup produced some of the most memorable blues, psychedelic and hard rock tunes of that time, Cream disbanded due to Baker and Bruce's ever-escalating antagonism and competitiveness. However, the legacy they've left behind inspired generations of rock artists to come.

                    <p class="bio">Creedence Clearwater Revival's John Fogerty (guitar, vocals, songwriting) Stu Cook (bass) and Doug Clifford (drums) all first met during their time in El Cerrito, California's Portola Junior High in 1959 and decided to start a band together. The trio called themselves The Blue Velvets and started playing instrumentals, in addition to backing Fogerty's older brother Tom at live gigs and studio recordings. Tom soon joined the band, and five years later, they signed a deal with Fantasy Records, which prompted them to change their name to The Golliwogs.

                        After a series of recorded singles which attracted little to no attention, the band was offered a record deal from Fantasy, now under new management, with another name-change being the crucial condition. The band members ultimately settled on Creedence Clearwater Revival as their new name, but it wasn't until the year after that they began recording their debut, as John Fogerty and Doug Clifford had been serving in the army at the time.
                        
                        Their self-titled debut turned out to be a huge success, and the band would continue to make powerful mixture of swamp, blues and roots rock, despite all of them being from the San Francisco Bay Area.
                        
                        After four years of immense chart-topping success, Tom Fogerty had left the band, and his younger brother John was having difficulties with resolving ever more frequent quarrels with their record label, as well as those between the other band members. Finally, Creedence Clearwater Revival disbanded in 1972 in a series of counter-fire disputes all across. Despite its inglorious disbanding, Creedence Clearwater Revival remains one of the most famous as well as the most influential Southern-inspired rock act of all time

                    <img src="https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/static/article/draft/125348_rI1iBZoHJfLMvabP_57926.jpg" alt="Photo of Cream Band">
                    <p class="bio">Warsaw, which would later be renamed into Joy Division, was formed in Salford UK, in 1976, and consisted of Ian Curtis (vocals), Bernard Sumner (guitars/keyboards), Peter Hook (bass) and Stephen Morris (drums). Sumner and Hook decided to form a band together after attending a Sex Pistols concert, and like their idols, they dedicated themselves to playing punk during the band's early years, but they would eventually swerve into then-unexplored grounds of melancholy post-punk.

                        After a self-released debut EP titled "An Ideal For Living", the band would draw enough attention to warrant them a record deal with Factory records, under whom they released their proper debut album, "Unknown Pleasures". At the same time that "Unknown Pleasures" was earning the band ever more praise and recognition, frontman Ian Curtis had been suffering heavily from a failing marriage, depression and epilepsy. Ultimately, Curtis tragically ended his own life, as well as that of Joy Division on the night before the band's first American tour in 1980. Their second studio album, Closer, was released a couple of months afterwards.
                        
                        Although the rest of the band members reinvented themselves as the equally iconic New Order, Joy Division's unique take on post-punk and soulful, melancholy rock ended with Curtis. Today, Joy Division are regarded as the forefathers of Goth and the significant amount of post- punk and rock, and remain one of the brightest stars within the genre despite burning out so tragically quickly.

                    <p class="bio">The Smiths were formed in 1982 in Manchester, and consisted of Morrissey (vocals), Johnny Marr (guitar), Andy Rourke (bass) and Mike Joyce (drums) and disbanded in 1987 due to rising personal differences. During their short-lived career, they released four studio albums, and early on became known as the band which rejected the popular dance-pop of the era, instead focusing on developing their own sound through traditional rock instruments, post-punk-influenced sound and Morissey's intensely literate lyrics. Their music was even more enhanced by their image, as the band also did away with all the glam and showbiz flair, and instead looked like a group of asocial nerds pulled out from the local library.

                        Since then, The Smiths have come to be acknowledged as perhaps the most important band to have emerged from the British independent music scene.
